MODULE 5 CHALLENGE: Pymaceuticals


Challenge: I was tasked with analyzing a study for a pharmaceutical company called Pymaceuticals. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Conclusion: Through this study, it is clear that Pymaceutical's drug, Capomulin, is definitely among the most effective in decreasing the volume of tumors in mice. It seems like a competitor's drug, Ramicane, is slightly more effective, but it is a marginal diffrence and Capomulin is definitely a top performer. 

I was able to accomplish this challenge by just looking back at previous solutions to class activities. We had a lot of class examples where the code was very similar to what we needed for this challenge, and I didn't really need to look anywhere else for answers. Specifically when I was stuck on the scatter plot and linear regression, referring back to  activities 8 and 9 from day 3 of Module 5 was able to get me going in the right direction. Overall I feel better about this challenge than most of the past ones and I hope the results are what was expected.  

Thank you for your time!
