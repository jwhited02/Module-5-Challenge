MODULE 5 CHALLENGE: Pymaceuticals

I was tasked with analyzing data from a company called Pymacauticals. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

File Structure: 
The data is located in two files which are in the "Resources" folder. The code is located in the "Analysis" folder. 

I was able to accomplish this challenge by just looking back at previous solutions to class activities. We had a lot of class examples that were very similar to what we needed to use in this challenge so I appreciated that!
